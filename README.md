# Sprint 3: Data Warehousing & Visualization

Repository for the join work of our Sprint 3 group coursework.

## Repo management

1. Ensure all commits have useful commit messages

2. Branches should be issue specific (e.g front end page development, back end issue fixing)

3. Avoid force-pushing to shared branches, as this can overwrite changes made by others and cause conflicts.
    
4. Try and follow a similar coding style. This makes it easier for others to read and maintain the code.

5. Similarly try and comment parts of code that are complex or just not easy to follow.

6. Create an issue for what you are working on so the group is aware of the current functions being worked on.

7. Try and keep your local files updated regularly so you are not working on deprecated code.
